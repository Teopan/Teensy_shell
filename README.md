# Teensy_shell
A pretty basic C++ script for teensy. You can compile it with Arduino IDE.
It opens a command prompt with administration privileges and then runs a powershell meterpreter reverse shell in a windows target machine. Works with the Metasploit console.
You have to change the line 151 to match with your IP address and to open a PORT.
